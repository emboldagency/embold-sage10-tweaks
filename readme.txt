A collection of tweaks and changes to the Sage 10 framework.

== Description ==

There are common things we'll need to change in every Sage 10 theme, this plugin simplifies making all these changes with
a drag and drop plugin.

1. Enqueues app.css styles in only the Gutenberg editor, not the entire admin panel.
2. Add "wp-block-paragraph" class to Gutenberg paragraph blocks to allow easier styling of the blocks vs ACF wysiwyg p's.
3. Add "wp-block-ul" and "wp-block-ol" classes to Gutenberg list blocks to allow easier targeting.
4. Always make sure the default block library is loaded even when Soil is installed and set to clean.
