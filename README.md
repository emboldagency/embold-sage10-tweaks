# Tweaks and Changes to Sage 10

There are common things we'll need to change in every Sage 10 theme, this plugin simplifies making all these changes wit
a drag and drop plugin.


1. Enqueues app.css styles in only the Gutenberg editor, not the entire admin panel.
2. Add "wp-block-paragraph" class to Gutenberg paragraph blocks to allow easier styling of the blocks vs ACF wysiwyg p's.
3. Add "wp-block-ul" and "wp-block-ol" classes to Gutenberg list blocks to allow easier targeting.
